Took time off to travel after saving upâ€”spent several months exploring **Brazil**, **Colombia**, **Vietnam**, **China**, and **Taiwan**. It was an incredible chance to see the world, meet new people, and get a fresh perspective. Came back recharged, more open-minded, and more motivated than ever.
